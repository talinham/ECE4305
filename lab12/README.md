A square test-pattern generator produces a screen as follows:   
• A square lie on the middle of the screen.   
• The side of the square can be 16, 32, 64, or 128 pixels and can be selected by 
switches.   
• The color of the square can be set by switches.   
• The background displays the complement color. The complement color of (r, g, b) 
is (1111 – r, 1111 – g, 1111 – b)   
 
Design the new circuit, replace the bar test-pattern generator in the basic video controller 
demo and verify its operation.
