#### Hardware Used:

Digilent's Nexys Artix-7 FPGA Board

#### Software Used:

Vivado 2019.2

### Description:

This lab's objective was to code a programmable square wave generator. The circuit would need to be able to generate a square wave with variable on (logic ’1’) and off (logic ’0’) intervals. The durations of those intervals are specified by two 4-bit control signals, m and n, which are interpreted as unsigned integers. The circuit should be completely synchronous. The output of the circuit will be verified with Vivado's integrated logic analyzer.
