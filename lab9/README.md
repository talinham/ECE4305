# lab 9: Spectrum Display Group 10
lab-9-spectrum-display-group10 created by GitHub Classroom

A rainbow-like spectrum is shown in the figure below. The spectrum can be generated by 
varying the intensity of the red, green, and blue inputs of the tricolor LEDs. A rainbow light uses 
the potentiometer and XADC core as the input to specify the desired color on a tricolor LED. 
Derive the program and verify its operation. 
 
The x axis shows the voltage value as read by the XADC core, you should display this value on 
the seven segment display using the LED-MUX core.
